# Secret Spot
Secret Spot is an application very similar to Instagram but targeted specifically to Skateboarders, BMX riders, and extreme sports enthusiasts alike. The apps purpose is to give these athletes an opportunity to share their street spots for other to enjoy. A lot of the time street spots can be hard to come by and telling others about them can be hard as well. Whether it is describing the actual location or the obstacle that is there, itâ€™s a pain. That is the problem that this app solves. It allows users to create a profile, share their photos, and share the skate spots they either frequent or stumbled upon accidentally. For other users not looking to share they can still look at the locations other athletes have discovered and explore those spots themselves.

# Biggest Problems 
The biggest problems I ran into during this project was passing payloads when either, posting, updating, or deleting. That concept within React was a bit tricky for me but once I got it figured it out it was clear as day. Secondly styling was a problem for me as it always is. This time I did spend a lot more time on my wireframes and planning my components and I do believe my app is in line with my wireframes but there are still a lot of design decisions that I need to learn to be able to make. I LOVE REACT BTW.

# Lessons Learned 
The biggest leason I learned is probably how EASY it is to just start styling your app in mobile instead of stlying in desktop. I learned how affective and time effecient it can be to just begin designing in mobile because designing for desktop and then going back and trying to figure out media queries for mobile is a lot more time consuming. I also learned findByIdandUpdate requires more than just the id. You have to pass in the ID and the thing you want to update. After reading up on that function I feel like me and him are going to become good friends.

# Phase 2 
In phase 2 I would like to make my app mobile responsive because most of the athletes are going to want to bring their computer to a skate spot and check in at their location. I see this app being used on mobile almost always unless a user is doing research before they go out. I also would like to pull in the Google Places or Foursquare API so users can actually check in using the spots longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates making it even easier for the athletes to find spots. Finally I would also like to set up OAuth so users can actually login in and own their data without risking other manipulating it.
